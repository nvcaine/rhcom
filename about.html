					Ever since I found out about the existence of computers, I was fascinated by them.
					When I received my first PC, one dream came true.
					I wanted to learn as much as possible about it, and as any child, I loved playing computer games.
					The games are the main driving force of imagination, thus I started forming my own ideas, which made me ask how games, and computer programs, are created.

					That was the humble beginning of a wonderful story, which is still in writing.
					As I learned more and more about programming, I eventually got around to writing my own code.
					At first, my attempts were modest; I discovered QBasic, and by going through the help section, and by copying the examples, I started writing my first programs, mainly basic animations.
					Later on, I moved to Borland Pascal and C++. Later still, I started learning OpenGL and DirectX.

			Afterwards, I started working and my first job was as PHP Developer.
			Working mainly with server-side scripts and MySQL databases.
			Gradually, I started learning about HTML and JavaScript, extending on the front-end side of the Web Development spectrum.
			For about 4 years, I worked with various tools, like jQuery, Zend Framework, Kohana, Wordpress, SVN etc.
			The experience gained while working as a Web Developer helped me to really understand what it truly takes to develop successful projects, and appreciate teamwork.

			Subsequently, I made a change towards a different type of projects.
			Not having any professional experience developing on the Flash platform, I decided it would be a great learning opportunity.
			As it turns out, it was a great decision.
			I had the opportunity to learn from very skilled people, work on complex data-management applications and learn to follow modern development processes.

				<p>
			Eventually, I qualified for a position at on of the largest local Software companies, which developed computer games.
			I was very excited to have the opportunity to work on real games, and I loved every minute of it.
			One of the things this experience taught me is that games are their own type of software.
			No other kind of software engages us in such a way, as a game.
			The immersive experience and the freedom of imagination is what inspired me initially to want to learn about Computer Programming, and eventually Software Engineering.
